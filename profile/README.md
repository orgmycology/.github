# [Organizational Mycology](https://orgmycology.com)

Is a small team that helps organizations to explore how they already have all the connections they need to thrive among their people.
We take inspiration from biology and use the tools of social science research to empower organizations and the people that contribute to them.

# Our work 

- [Astropy](https://astropy.org) - We worked with the Astropy Community to help them conduct a [community survey](https://astropy-report.orgmycology.com), [community views on DEI](https://astropy-dei.orgmycology.com), and supported their community leaders to grow the reach and ipmact of the Astropy project.
- [MolSSI](https://molssi.org) - We [worked with the Molecular Science Software Sustainability Institute](https://orgmycology.com/client-molssi) to help them build a collective vision for their project once major grant funding expires.
- [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) EOSS Community Calls - You can [learn more about these community calls](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/open-science/opensci-communitycalls.html) and see [the outputs we create from them](https://github.com/eoss-om-communitycalls#hi-there--welcome-to-the-eoss-community-call-landing-page).
- [Data Science Skills Map](https://github.com/jduckles/dsskills) - Jonah developed [a skills map](https://github.com/jduckles/dsskills) to help frame conversations around the skills needed to do data science in academic and scientific spaces, and beyond.
- [Scientific Open Source Landscape](https://github.com/orgmycology/scienceosslandscape) - A Venn diagram that has helped us to understand how major open source software project fit into the broader science systems and how their roles can continue to grow and interconnect to enable more productive science.
